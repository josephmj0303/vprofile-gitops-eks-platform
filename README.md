# VProfile GitOps Deployment Platform on AWS EKS

## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete production-grade GitOps platform for deploying and managing the VProfile application on AWS EKS using Terraform, GitHub Actions, Docker, Helm, and Amazon ECR.

The platform separates infrastructure provisioning and application deployment into independent repositories, implementing proper GitOps architecture used in real-world production environments.

## Related Repositories

This GitOps platform consists of separate repositories for infrastructure and application deployment:

| Repository | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [vprofile-gitops-iac](https://github.com/josephmj0303/vprofile-gitops-iac) | Terraform infrastructure provisioning for AWS EKS |
| [vprofile-gitops-app-deploy](https://github.com/josephmj0303/vprofile-gitops-app-deploy) | CI/CD pipeline and Kubernetes deployment using GitHub Actions and Helm |

These repositories work together to implement a complete GitOps deployment platform.

## 🔁 Deployment Workflow

![Deployment Flow](architecture/aws-resource-diagram.png)

---
## CI/CD Workflow

Infrastructure Deployment Workflow:

Push Terraform Code → GitHub Actions → Terraform Apply → AWS Infrastructure Created


Application Deployment Workflow:

Push Application Code → GitHub Actions → Test → SonarCloud Scan →
Docker Build → Push to ECR → Helm Deploy → Application Running on EKS


---

## AWS Resources Created

Infrastructure includes:

- VPC
- Public and Private Subnets
- Internet Gateway
- Route Tables
- EKS Cluster
- Node Groups
- ECR Repository
- Load Balancer
- IAM Roles

---

## Kubernetes Components Deployed

Application deployment creates:

- Kubernetes Deployment
- Kubernetes Service
- Kubernetes Ingress
- ConfigMaps
- Secrets

Managed using Helm.

---

## Application Architecture

Application components:

- Frontend: Java Web Application
- Database: MySQL
- Cache: Memcached
- Messaging: RabbitMQ

Cache improves performance by reducing database load.
